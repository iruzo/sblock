# Simple version of [hblock](https://github.com/hectorm/hblock)

This script will create a section at the bottom of your Hosts file or update that section if it has already been created.

(:warning: hBlock by default **replaces the hosts file of your system**, sBlock will **not** replace your hosts file content.)

## Usage
```sh
sudo sh <(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iruzo/sblock/master/sblock)
```
